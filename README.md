Radical Directoryâ€™s goal is to create a better way for activists to share
information about their organisations, campaigns and events.

Our current proposal is to build a [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client to enable decentralised, open, end-to-end encrypted event organising. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/radicaldirectory/organ).
